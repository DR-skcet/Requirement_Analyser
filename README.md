********AI-Powered Automated Requirement Gathering System********

****Overview****
This project leverages generative AI to automate the extraction and structuring of software requirements from multiple input formats such as PDFs, Word documents, Excel sheets, emails, images, and web pages. By integrating domain knowledge from public regulations and standards, it produces clear, standardized functional and non-functional requirements.

****Features****
Upload and process diverse document types and textual inputs

Extract key requirements using LLaMA 3 powered by Groq API Cloud

Apply domain standards using embeddings and vector similarity search (FAISS)

Generate organized, compliant, and unambiguous requirement documents

Real-time interaction for clarifications and improved accuracy

****Technology Stack****
Backend Framework: FastAPI (Python)

AI Model: LLaMA 3 via Groq API Cloud

Document Parsing: PyMuPDF, python-docx, openpyxl, Tesseract OCR

Embeddings & Search: HuggingFace embeddings, FAISS

Deployment: Cloud-ready with Groq AI acceleration

****Impact****
Speeds up and automates requirement gathering workflows

Enhances compliance with regulations and industry standards

Reduces ambiguity and human error

Scalable and adaptable for enterprise needs
