**AI-Powered Automated Requirement Gathering System**


This project utilizes advanced generative AI models to automate the extraction and structuring of software requirements from a wide range of inputs, including PDFs, Word documents, Excel sheets, emails, images, and web pages. By combining cutting-edge LLaMA 3 models powered through the Groq API Cloud with domain knowledge from public regulations and standards, the system delivers clear, well-organized functional and non-functional requirements.

The backend is built with FastAPI, enabling efficient handling of diverse document types through libraries like PyMuPDF, python-docx, and Tesseract OCR for text and image parsing. Requirements are enriched using semantic embeddings from HuggingFace and indexed with FAISS to ensure contextual compliance and relevance by referencing regulatory standards dynamically.

This AI-driven approach streamlines the traditionally manual and error-prone requirement gathering process, significantly speeding up project initiation phases while reducing ambiguity and improving regulatory compliance. The solution is designed for scalability and integration into enterprise workflows, making it a valuable tool for businesses aiming to modernize their software development lifecycle with intelligent automation.
